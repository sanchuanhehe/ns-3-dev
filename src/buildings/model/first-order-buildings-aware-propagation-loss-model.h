 * @brief The FirstOrderBuildingsAwarePropagationLossModel takes into account the presence
 * or not of buildings in the sight of nodes to compute loss. To limit the complexity and
 * computation overhead, we limit the reflection of signal to one and consider only one
 * diffraction effect (thus 'First Order'). Based on dominant path method, we compute only
 * the strongest diffraction and reflection, then use the least loss amoung LOS, penetration,
 * difraction and reflection to use as loss to apply to the signal.
 *
 * @warning This model is meant to introduce realistic path loss by considering interaction
 * of the signal with buildings, however, it has a level of abstraction, it does not reflect
 * the exact behavior that the signal would have in real life.
